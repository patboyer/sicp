SICP Exercises
====

Practicing the problems in MIT's "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)"

I started working through SICP as a way to learn Clojure. I also want to attempt the same 
programs in Ruby and C.

I have only included the exercises that most interested me (usually programming problems).

To run a single Clojure file:
java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main /path/to/clojure_file.clj

To compile and execute a C file (example):
gcc -o answer answer.c -lrt -lm
